    <p>
      In the Land of Ooo, Princess Bubblegum has been kidnapped. No one knows who took her or where she was taken. Amid the panic in the Candy Kingdom, a group of characters unite to uncover her whereabouts, armed with only one clue: whoever abducted her also stole a powerful artifact—the book known as the "Enchiridion." In the wrong hands, this tome could jeopardize the entire multiverse.<br/>
      The Enchiridion is a legendary book within the Adventure Time universe, initially introduced as a guide for heroes. However, it possesses profound magical properties. When specific gems are inserted into designated slots within the book, it can open portals to various dimensions of the multiverse. This capability makes it an object of immense power and danger if misused.<br/>
      Given the Enchiridion's potential to access and possibly disrupt the multiverse, its theft alongside Princess Bubblegum's abduction raises significant concerns. The group seeking to rescue her must not only find the princess but also prevent the misuse of the Enchiridion to safeguard the balance of the multiverse.

      <h1>Kaela Shadowveil</h1>
      <h2>Attributes</h2>
      <ul>

      </ul>
      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Kaela speaks only when necessary. She is cold, patient, and highly disciplined. Every move is calculated, every strike deliberate. She has no room for mercy — only efficiency. Her past is cloaked in rumors: some say she was raised by an elite assassin order; others claim she betrayed her mentors to carve her own path. She is not driven by vengeance or gold — but by the thrill of absolute control over life and death.</p>

        <li>Special Abilities:
          <ul>
            <li>Spiritual Bloom – Every 3 turns, Merlírio passively restores +10 HP to all allies.</li>
            <li>Leaf Whisper – Can commune with nature to detect enemies or locate resources.</li>
            <li>Forest Shield – Summons vines and bark to protect an ally, absorbing damage for a short duration.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Merlírio is serene and gentle, with a heart as vast as the forest. Often lost in the subtle rhythms of nature, he may appear distracted — listening to the rustle of leaves, the hum of insects, or the distant call of birds — but his awareness runs deep. He speaks with plants, follows the guidance of the stars, and places great trust in the wisdom of the wind. In the chaos of battle, Merlírio might stop to mend a wounded squirrel, even as explosions erupt around him. He believes that all life, no matter how small, is sacred and worth saving.</p>

        <li>Special Ability: Dodge – Can evade incoming attacks due to long-range positioning and agility.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Áster exists beyond human norms. Entirely disconnected from social constructs, they show no understanding of ethics, customs, or even basic interaction. There is no malice in their actions — only instinct and precision. They do not speak unless absolutely necessary, and when they do, it is usually in brief, strange observations disconnected from context. Though they may appear cold or emotionless, Áster is not cruel — they simply lack the frame of reference for morality. There is a haunting innocence to them, like a spirit mimicking a body. People fear Áster not for who they are, but because they are a mirror that reflects nothing back.</p>

        <li>Special Ability: Phoenix Embrace (Buff) – Every 2 rounds, Dussekar’s fire damage increases by +5 DPM, stacking until interrupted or reset.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Dussekar is impulsive, passionate, and brimming with raw energy. He’s a doer, not a thinker — the kind who lights the fuse and figures out the rest later. He lives intensely: when he loves, he burns bright; when he’s angry, he’s a wildfire. Hot-headed but loyal, he never backs down from a fight — especially when it’s for something he believes in. His fiery magic mirrors his nature: explosive, wild, and impossible to ignore.</p>

      The group receives some information, leading you to suspect that the one who kidnapped her was the Lich. However, you are not strong enough to face him in your current condition. Do you want to go straight to the forest to gather equipment and resources to begin your search for her, or would you rather look for clues at the tavern?
